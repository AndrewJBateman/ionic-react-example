### Included in this Ionic React Template/UI
* NodeJS Server for fetching data
* Data fetching from API (Yelp)
* Maps using Pigeon Maps
* Custom design
* Dynamic map
* View all / View single
* Geolocation for current location
* State management with Pullstate
* Custom animations
* SASS Modules & Ionic CSS utilities

**NOTE:**
Please don't push your API Keys to your live production apps. I've left my API key in there for demo purposes as it's a test account and it doesn't affect me. Also remember to ensure your API/Server is also secure.

### To run

```javascript
npm install
node server.js
ionic serve
```

Alternatively, you can add the iOS, Android platform and run natively.
